Description: 
WJRS is a Windows standalone application written in Processing 3.3 to solve the "Die Hard Problem": https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/02/04/the-water-jug-riddle/
It features a custom GUI interface with 3 input boxes, a submit button, and a dynamic, scrollable output window. 
It uses the ControlP5 library for I/O with text fields.

How to run:
Double clicking the executable will run the program.

How to use:

1. Enter size of Water Jug (or "Bucket") A
2. Enter size of Water Jug (or "Bucket") B
3. Enter desired volume
4. Click the "submit" button
5. Observe output window, scroll up/down if needed to view full output.

Troubleshooting issues:
You need Java 1.8 in order to run the program.
I encountered a "cannot find OpenGL" error when running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit computer, which ended up solving itself after 20 seconds.
